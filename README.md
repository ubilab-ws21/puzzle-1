# Divert power to machine room door (puzzle-1)
This puzzle is the first part of the 2021 ESCLAB.
According to that orange american man that once was US president, it's the best puzzle the world has ever seen.

## Objective
Divert the emergency power to the door that prevents you fom entering the second room.

## Story
There is some wiring on the wall. When you'll find some more panels to create the connection maybe you can divert the power to the door. Apparently the emergency power has not been used in ages.

You spot a cube on the table in the room thats sides look like panels that yould be used for that.

Upon further inspection you see that the cube starts sparkling when moving it in the hand. Also there are weird symbols on each side.  
Also in the room there is some kind of comic, that has the symbols in the title and a hint "to the sun".  
Maybe placing the cube with the symbols of the comic towards the sun (top) in the correct order it will open.

After finishing the sequence the cube lights up greeen and suddenly the panels will unlatch so you can take 'em off.  
You solve the wire-maze, given by the panels and place them so the connection between "emergency power" and the keypad is created on the wall.  
The door opens and you step into the next room.

And then you die. Or maybe something nicer happens - that's up to the people doing the next puzzles. :)
