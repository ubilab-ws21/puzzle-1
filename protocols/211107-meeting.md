| Type | Content/Result | Name & Date |
|:----:| -------------- | ----------- |
| I |Update for Kevin about content of lab meeting from 04.11.2021<br>- Box to unlock the door to next room<br>- Has to be placed in a special orientation to be unlockable<br>- Unlocking by solving a wiring-challenge on the side of the box | |
| I | Rethinking game idea<br>- Box is small, therefore wiring -challenge would be (too) small<br>- No good story idea, why the wires should be on the box | |
| I | modification ideas for the game<br>- Box is small, therefore connection-challenge would be (too) small<br>- Insufficient ideas of how and why to orient the box<br>- Wiring could be “bypassing of a lock on the box”, not quite ubiquitous. | |
| I | Extending the game idea (Wiring)<br>- wiring-challenge will be part of the room<br>- creating the correct connection will enable the keypad at the door<br>- will be a more easy challenge<br>- box will contain needed components for wiring and has to be opened first | |
| I | Extending the game idea (design & unlocking of box)<br>- Box contains multi-color LEDs on all sides<br>- 6 Sides – 6 different Symbols<br>- Box has to be placed with the correct symbols up in a given order<br>- IDLE: Box is sleeping, no LED on.<br>- Moving the box: LEDs start to sparkle<br>- Correct placement: LEDs will flash green, then go back to sparkle<br>- Wrong placement: LEDs will flash red, lock input for x seconds.<br>- Correct order of input: LED will light up green in increasing intensity and then open. | |
| I | Updating the game idea #1 (Lazy as f* solution)<br>- Box will be simple box (wood) with a lid, containing wires for wiring-challenge | |
| I | Updating the game idea #2 (Fallback solution)<br>- Box will be simple box (wood) with a lid, containing square tiles used for wiring | |
| I | Updating the game idea #3 (Primary goal!)<br>- Box will be a 3D-printed box<br>- Side panels of the Box will be needed for wiring | |
| I | Recapitulation of presented Game-Idea
| I | Bill of materials has been written by hand | |
